Build a complete spatial guinea worm transmission model for Chad using the
LASER framework with these specifications:

Disease dynamics:
- SEIS (no lasting immunity — guinea worm confers no acquired immunity,
  recovered individuals return to susceptible)
- Humans: R0≈1.5, 365-day pre-patent period, 21-day worm emergence
- Dogs: R0≈2.5, 365-day pre-patent period, 21-day worm emergence
- Water-source mediated transmission (not direct contact — larvae released
  into water, ingested via copepods)
- Cross-species coupling via shared water sources (asymmetric: dogs are
  the dominant reservoir, ~95% of infections)

Spatial structure:
- 8 districts in the endemic corridor with heterogeneous populations
  (human/dog): Chari-Baguirmi (450k/40k), Moyen-Chari (400k/35k),
  Salamat (350k/30k), Mandoul (300k/25k), Logone Oriental (250k/20k),
  Tandjile (200k/15k), Mayo-Kebbi Est (150k/10k), Lac (100k/5k)
- Gravity-model spatial coupling representing shared water source networks

Seasonality:
- Dry-season peak (Jan-Mar at 1.8x, rainy season Jun-Sep at 0.4x)

Interventions (all prevention-based, no vaccine exists):
- ABATE larvicide: starts at 30% coverage year 1, increases 10%/year to
  max 90%
- Filter distribution: starts at 40%, increases 10%/year to max 90%
- Case containment: 70% efficacy, improving 3%/year
- Dog tethering: 40% coverage, increasing 5%/year

Initial conditions (near-elimination context):
- Seed 5 infected humans and 200 infected dogs in the 3 most endemic
  districts (Chari-Baguirmi, Moyen-Chari, Salamat)
- Importation: 1 infected human traveler every 90 days for first 3 years

Simulation:
- 10-year simulation
- Output: annual human cases and dog infections per district
- Track whether elimination (zero cases for 3 consecutive years) is
  achieved and when
