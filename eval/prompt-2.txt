Extend the basic LASER polio model to include:
1. A gravity-model migration network between patches, with distance decay
   exponent c=1.5 and destination population exponent b=0.5
2. Seasonal forcing that peaks during July-October (monsoon season) with
   amplitude 1.3x baseline and troughs during December-March at 0.7x baseline
3. Row-normalize the network so no patch exports more than 15% of its
   force of infection

Write complete Python code using the LASER framework. Assume patches are
arranged in a line 50km apart. Do not install any packages.
