Design a calibration framework for the guinea worm LASER model using real
surveillance data from the Carter Center's Guinea Worm Eradication Program
in Chad:

Observed annual data (human cases / dog infections):
- 2018: 17 / 1,040
- 2019: 48 / 1,935
- 2020: 12 / 1,507
- 2021: 14 / 830
- 2022: 13 / 688
- 2023: 6 / 526

The calibration should:
1. Match total annual human cases and dog infections using log-scale
   comparison (appropriate for small counts)
2. Reproduce the ~50:1 to 100:1 dog-to-human infection ratio
3. Capture the declining trend in both species reflecting intervention
   scale-up over this period
4. Account for spatial concentration: cases cluster in 3-4 of 8 districts
   (Chari-Baguirmi, Moyen-Chari, Salamat, Mandoul)

Sample from parameter ranges:
- beta_human: U(0.0005, 0.005)
- beta_dog: U(0.005, 0.05)
- cross_species_coupling: U(0.05, 0.5)
- seasonal_amplitude: U(0.3, 0.8)
- containment_efficacy: U(0.5, 0.9)

Use a multi-objective fitness function with appropriate weighting for the
different targets. Write the calibration loop and scoring functions using
LASER framework conventions. Do not install any packages.
