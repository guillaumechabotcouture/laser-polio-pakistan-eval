Using the LASER framework (laser-generic package), create a basic spatial disease model for a respiratory illness in the Republic of Eastland. Set up a Model with a 4-patch GeoDataFrame scenario (populations: 100k, 200k, 150k, 80k; all susceptible) and a PropertySet with nticks=365 and prng_seed=42. Call model.run() to execute a 1-year simulation. Write complete Python code. Do not install any packages.
