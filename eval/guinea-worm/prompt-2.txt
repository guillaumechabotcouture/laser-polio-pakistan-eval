Extend the guinea worm LASER model to include realistic transmission dynamics:

1. Water-source mediated transmission: Guinea worm spreads when infected hosts
   enter stagnant water to soothe emerging worms, releasing larvae that are
   ingested by copepods, which are then consumed by new hosts drinking
   unfiltered water. Model spatial coupling based on shared water sources —
   neighboring districts share seasonal ponds and rivers, with coupling
   strength decaying with distance (exponent c=2.0, destination population
   exponent b=0.3)

2. Dry-season transmission forcing: Stagnant pools during Chad's dry season
   (Oct-May) concentrate copepods and increase transmission. Peak transmission
   Jan-Mar at 1.8x baseline, declining through Apr-May. Rainy season (Jun-Sep)
   at 0.4x baseline as flowing water dilutes copepod density and disperses
   larvae.

3. Cross-host transmission via shared water sources: Dogs and humans
   contaminate the same water bodies. In Chad, dog infections drive the
   epidemic (~95% of cases), so dog-to-water-to-human transmission is
   critical. Use asymmetric cross-species coupling reflecting dogs' higher
   contribution.

Maintain SEIS dynamics (no lasting immunity — recovered hosts return to
susceptible). Write complete Python code using the LASER framework.
