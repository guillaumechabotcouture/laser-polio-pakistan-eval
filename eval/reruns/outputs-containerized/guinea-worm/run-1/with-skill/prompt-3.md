Already retrieved that output in the previous response — the task ran successfully through the entire 10-year simulation and all 9 verification checks passed. The exit code 1 came only from the final `plot_results()` call failing to write the PNG to a read-only path (`/workspace/eval/guinea-worm/outputs/`), not from any model logic. All the epidemiological results and verification were printed before that error.
