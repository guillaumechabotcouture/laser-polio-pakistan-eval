Pre-allocated capacity per patch (safety_factor=2.0):
  Patch 0 (N₀=100,000):  capacity = 177,206  (+77% headroom)
  Patch 1 (N₀=200,000):  capacity = 354,412  (+77% headroom)
  Patch 2 (N₀=150,000):  capacity = 265,809  (+77% headroom)
  Patch 3 (N₀= 80,000):  capacity = 141,765  (+77% headroom)
  Total pre-allocated: 939,192

Gravity network row sums (export fractions):
  Patch 0 → ['0.0000', '0.1118', '0.0296', '0.0086']  (total export = 0.1500)
  Patch 1 → ['0.0539', '0.0000', '0.0809', '0.0152']  (total export = 0.1500)
  Patch 2 → ['0.0168', '0.0951', '0.0000', '0.0381']  (total export = 0.1500)
  Patch 3 → ['0.0120', '0.0442', '0.0938', '0.0000']  (total export = 0.1500)

Seasonal profile: mean=1.0000, peak=1.30x (days 0–90 each year), trough=0.70x (days 150–240 each year)

Running gravity 4-patch SEIR model — seasonal forcing + vital dynamics
  β=0.500 d⁻¹,  R₀=5.0,  latent=4d,  infectious=10d
  Gravity: k=0.01, a=1.0, b=1.0, c=1.5
  Spacing: 75 km;  max export fraction: 15%
  Patches (pop): [100000, 200000, 150000, 80000]
  Init: 90% S / 0% E / 1% I / 9% R
  Seasonal: winter 1.3x (d0–90/yr), summer 0.7x (d150–240/yr)
  Vital: CBR=30/1000/yr, CDR=10/1000/yr (net ~2%/yr)
Simulation complete.

Population at start and end:
  Day    0:     530,000
  Day 3650:     644,150
  Change:      +114,150  (+21.5% over 10 yr)
  Observed annual growth: 1.97%  (expected ~2.00% from CBR–CDR = 30–10 = 20/1000/yr)

All validation checks passed.

Summary:
  Peak total infectious : 242,478
