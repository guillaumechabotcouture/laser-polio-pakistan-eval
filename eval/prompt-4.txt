Design a calibration framework for the LASER polio model that:
1. Compares simulated incidence to AFP (Acute Flaccid Paralysis) surveillance
   data, accounting for the ~1:200 paralysis-to-infection ratio
2. Uses a fitness metric based on the proportion of zero-incidence weeks per
   district (similar to critical community size analysis)
3. Samples from these parameter ranges:
   - beta: U(0.15, 0.30)
   - gravity_k: 10^U(-3, -1)
   - seasonal_amplitude: U(1.0, 1.5)
4. Ranks simulations by goodness of fit

Write the calibration loop and scoring functions. Use LASER framework
conventions. Do not install any packages.
