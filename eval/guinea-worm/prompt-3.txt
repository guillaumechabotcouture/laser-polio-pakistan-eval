Add prevention-based interventions to the guinea worm LASER model. No vaccine
exists for guinea worm — all control relies on breaking the water transmission
cycle:

1. ABATE (temephos) larvicide: Applied monthly to known water sources during
   transmission season, kills copepods, reduces water-source transmission by
   80% in treated areas. Coverage varies by district (20-80%).

2. Cloth/pipe water filters: Distributed to households, removes copepods from
   drinking water. Current adoption ~60% nationally, each filter reduces
   individual ingestion risk by 95%.

3. Case containment: When a worm emerges, the case is detected and the patient
   is prevented from entering water sources for the ~30-day emergence period.
   70% of human cases are successfully contained, reducing their contribution
   to water contamination by 90%.

4. Dog tethering/management: 50% of villages with known dog infections tether
   infected dogs to prevent water access during worm emergence, reducing
   dog-to-water transmission by 85%.

Show the complete component setup using LASER's framework. These must work
with SEIS dynamics (recovered individuals return to susceptible, since there
is no lasting immunity to guinea worm). Do not install any packages.
