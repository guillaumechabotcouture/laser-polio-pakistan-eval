# Project Context

This is a public health epidemiological modeling project by the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation's Global Health division. The work supports polio eradication
efforts by building spatial transmission models to evaluate vaccination
strategies across Pakistan's districts.

All modeling uses the open-source LASER framework (https://laser.idmod.org/)
from the Institute for Disease Modeling (IDM). The models simulate disease
dynamics at the population level using standard SEIR compartmental frameworks
— no pathogen-specific biological details beyond basic epidemiological
parameters (R0, infectious period, etc.) are involved.

This is purely computational epidemiology for public health planning.
