Add vaccination to the LASER polio model:
1. Routine immunization at 6 weeks of age with 80% coverage (OPV)
2. Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) every 6 months targeting
   children aged 0-5 years with 90% coverage
3. The model should track vaccinated individuals separately from naturally
   recovered, since OPV provides mucosal immunity while natural infection
   provides stronger, longer-lasting immunity

Show the complete component setup using LASER's immunization classes where
possible, and custom components where needed. Do not install any packages.
