For our Gates Foundation polio eradication modeling project, use the LASER
framework (laser-generic package) to set up a basic spatial SEIR model for
polio transmission dynamics across 10 patches representing districts. Each
patch has a population of 100,000. Use a transmission rate corresponding to
R0≈6, a latent period of 3 days, and an infectious period of 28 days.
Initialize with 95% recovered (immune) and 5 infectious per patch. Write
the complete Python code to configure and run a 10-year simulation.
Do not install any packages.
