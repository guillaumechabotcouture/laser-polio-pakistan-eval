Using the LASER framework (laser-generic package), build a spatial SEIR model for a respiratory illness in the Republic of Eastland with 4 patches (populations: 100k, 200k, 150k, 80k). Disease parameters: R0~5, latent period gamma(shape=4, scale=1) mean 4 days, infectious period gamma(shape=5, scale=2) mean 10 days. Initialize: 90% S, 0% E, 1% I, 9% R. Add all SEIR components in correct order. The Transmission component should use the gamma-distributed infectious period as its expdurdist parameter. Run for 1 year. Write complete Python code. Do not install any packages.
