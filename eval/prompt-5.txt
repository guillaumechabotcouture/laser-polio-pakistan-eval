Build a complete spatial polio transmission model for Pakistan using the LASER
framework with these specifications:
- 20 districts with heterogeneous populations (range 50k-2M)
- SEIR dynamics with R0≈6, 3-day latent period, 28-day infectious period
- Gravity-model spatial coupling
- Monsoon-season transmission forcing (peak Jul-Oct)
- OPV routine immunization at 80% coverage
- SIA campaigns every 6 months
- Importation of 3 infections every 60 days for the first 5 years
- 20-year simulation with 10-year burn-in
- Output: weekly incidence per district, proportion of zero-incidence weeks
