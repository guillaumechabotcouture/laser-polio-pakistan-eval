For our Gates Foundation guinea worm eradication modeling project, use the LASER
framework (laser-generic package) to set up a spatial disease model for guinea
worm (Dracunculus medinensis) transmission in Chad. Key disease biology:

- Guinea worm confers NO lasting immunity — recovered individuals return to
  susceptible (use SEIS dynamics, not SEIR)
- Pre-patent period: 10-14 months (from copepod ingestion to worm emergence)
- Infectious period: 2-4 weeks (during worm emergence through skin)
- R0 ≈ 1.5-2 (low, water-mediated transmission through copepods)
- Transmission is water-mediated: infected hosts enter water sources, release
  larvae, copepods ingest larvae, new hosts drink contaminated water

Model 8 patches representing endemic districts in southern Chad. Track two
host populations: humans (total ~2M across patches, range 100k-500k per
district) and dogs (~200K total, range 10k-50k per district), since dogs are
the dominant reservoir in Chad (~95% of detected infections are in dogs).

Initialize in a near-elimination state reflecting current conditions: seed
2 infected humans and 50 infected dogs nationally, distributed across the
3 most endemic patches. All others susceptible.

Write complete Python code to run a 5-year simulation. Output annual case
counts for both species. Do not install any packages.
