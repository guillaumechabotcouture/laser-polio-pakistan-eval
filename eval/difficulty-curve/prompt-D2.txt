Using the LASER framework (laser-generic package), build a spatial SEIR model for a respiratory illness in the Republic of Eastland with 4 patches (populations: 100k, 200k, 150k, 80k). The disease has R0~5, a latent period of 4 days (gamma distributed, shape=4, scale=1), and an infectious period of 10 days (gamma distributed, shape=5, scale=2). Initialize with 90% susceptible, 0% exposed, 1% infectious, 9% recovered. Add all SEIR state components (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) and Transmission in the correct order. Run for 1 year. Write complete Python code. Do not install any packages.
