Guinea worm has a water-mediated cycle (host → water → copepod → host). Should the model track water contamination explicitly as a separate environmental compartment, or use a simplified force-of-infection?

**Option A: Explicit water compartment (recommended)** — Track contamination level per node. Each intervention acts at its mechanistic point: ABATE/containment/tethering reduce contamination, filters reduce ingestion. More realistic for intervention evaluation.

**Option B: Simplified force-of-infection** — Abstract water cycle into a single transmission rate with intervention multipliers. Simpler but less mechanistically clear.

Which approach do you prefer?
